## About Haus

Haus is a collaborative, non-commercial exhibition format that brings together a variety of artistic, curatorial and discursive interventions in an intimate setting. By creating an experimental platform where different exhibition strategies, structures and formats meet, the project is envisioned as a tool for exploring new ideas for showcasing artworks and accompanying formats.

The ideas of Haus are rooted in the independent scene: non-profit and artist-run exhibition spaces, who demonstrate a flexible and intimate mode of collaborating within non-hierarchical structures. The aim is to provide a low-threshold mediation platform for contemporary artistic production and the surrounding discourse and community.

After a fruitful first edition in September 2020, counting roughly 50 participants from 15 countries as well as 1,000 visitors in total, we are now looking forward to realizing the second edition of the project as a catalyst to forge new alliances, friendships, and strategies of collaboration. Same as last year, participants are invited to apply with a proposal during an <a href="open-call">Open Call</a>. 

## Team

Haus was founded in 2020 by Marie-Claire Gagnon, Fanny Hauser, Bruno Mokross, Julius Pristauz, Johanna Thorell and Edin Zenun. The team is jointly managing the project and is supported by external advisors and helpers.
